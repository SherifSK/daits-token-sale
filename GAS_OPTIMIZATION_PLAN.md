# Gas Optimization Plan for DAITS Token

## Objective
Optimize the DaitsToken contract for reduced gas consumption while maintaining security and functionality.

## Current Status
- Base implementation: Complete and tested
- Security validation: Passed (0 vulnerabilities)
- Test coverage: 77 tests passing

## Gas Optimization Targets

### 1. Storage Optimization
- [ ] Analyze storage layout and packing opportunities
- [ ] Optimize state variable ordering
- [ ] Consider using packed structs for related variables

### 2. Function Optimization
- [ ] Replace `require` statements with custom errors
- [ ] Optimize modifier usage and function visibility
- [ ] Analyze loops and repetitive operations

### 3. External Call Optimization
- [ ] Minimize external contract calls
- [ ] Cache repeated external call results
- [ ] Optimize role checking patterns

### 4. Compiler Optimization
- [ ] Analyze assembly optimizations (if safe)
- [ ] Review Solidity optimizer settings
- [ ] Test different compiler versions for gas efficiency

### 5. Event Optimization
- [ ] Optimize event emission patterns
- [ ] Consider indexed vs non-indexed parameters
- [ ] Minimize event parameter sizes

## Benchmark Methodology
- Measure gas costs before and after each optimization
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Validate security properties remain intact
- Document gas savings for each optimization

## Success Criteria
- Reduce deployment gas cost by 5-15%
- Reduce function execution gas costs by 10-25%
- Maintain 100% test pass rate
- Preserve all security properties
- No impact on contract functionality

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk: Custom errors, storage packing
- Medium risk: Assembly optimizations, modifier changes
- High risk: Any changes affecting security logic

## Next Steps
1. Establish baseline gas measurements
2. Implement low-risk optimizations first
3. Test each optimization thoroughly
4. Document gas savings and trade-offs
5. Prepare comprehensive gas optimization report
